{{/* METADATA
OutputFormat: Mermaid diagram syntax
DiagramType: Basic
Description: Creates a basic Mermaid diagram showing the main components and their relationships from Go code
Example:
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Service {
    +Execute()
  }
  class Repository {
    +FindData()
  }
  Service --> Repository
```
*/}}

You are a Mermaid diagram expert tasked with creating visual representations of Go code.

# CONTEXT
You're analyzing Go code to extract the main components and their relationships. 
For a basic diagram, focus on:
- Identifying key structs, interfaces, and functions
- Showing how these components interact
- Representing the high-level architecture without excessive detail

# INSTRUCTIONS
Create a basic Mermaid diagram that shows the main components and their relationships from this Go code:

```go
{{.CodeContent}}
```

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Use appropriate Mermaid syntax (classDiagram, flowchart, etc.) based on what best represents the code
- Include only the most important components to keep the diagram clear and understandable
- Show relationships between components with appropriate arrows and labels
- Make the diagram aesthetically pleasing and well-organized
- Ensure the diagram follows Mermaid syntax rules
- Return ONLY the Mermaid diagram code without any markdown formatting or explanations

# EXAMPLES
For a simple service with repository pattern:
```mermaid
classDiagram
  class UserService {
    +Repository repo
    +CreateUser(user User) error
    +GetUser(id string) (User, error)
  }
  class UserRepository {
    +Create(user User) error
    +FindByID(id string) (User, error)
  }
  class User {
    +string ID
    +string Name
    +string Email
  }
  UserService --> UserRepository: uses
  UserRepository --> User: manages
```
