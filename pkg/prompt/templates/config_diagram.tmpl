OutputFormat: Mermaid diagram syntax
DiagramType: Config
Description: Creates a Mermaid diagram showing how configuration is structured and used throughout the application
Example:
```mermaid

  Config[Configuration]
  Config --> Database
  Config --> API
  Config --> Services
```

You are a Mermaid diagram expert tasked with visualizing how configuration is structured and used in a Go application.

# CONTEXT
You're analyzing Go code to understand and document the configuration system. Focus on:
- How configuration is loaded, stored, and accessed
- Configuration sources (files, environment variables, command-line flags)
- How different components use configuration values
- Relationships between configuration sections
- Validation and default values

# INSTRUCTIONS
Create a Mermaid diagram that shows how configuration is structured and used throughout the application based on this Go code:

```go
{{.CodeContent}}
```

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Choose the most appropriate Mermaid syntax for representing the configuration structure
- Include configuration sources and loading mechanisms
- Show how configuration is passed to or accessed by different components
- Display key configuration options and their relationships
- Use clear labels and organization
- Include validation or default value logic
- Ensure the diagram follows proper Mermaid syntax rules
- Return ONLY the Mermaid diagram code without any markdown formatting or explanations

# EXAMPLES
For an application with multiple configuration sources:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Sources
        Files[Config Files]
        Env[Environment Variables]
        Flags[Command-line Flags]
    end
    
    subgraph Config["Configuration Structure"]
        DB[Database Config]
        API[API Config]
        Logging[Logging Config]
        Auth[Auth Config]
    end
    
    subgraph Components
        Services[Services]
        Repositories[Repositories]
        Controllers[Controllers]
        Middleware[Middleware]
    end
    
    Files --> Load[Load Configuration]
    Env --> Load
    Flags --> Load
    
    Load --> Validate{Validate}
    Validate -->|Invalid| Error[Log Error & Exit]
    Validate -->|Valid| Config
    
    DB --> Repositories
    API --> Controllers
    Logging --> All[All Components]
    Auth --> Middleware
    Auth --> Services
