{{/* METADATA
OutputFormat: Mermaid flowchart syntax
DiagramType: Flowchart
Description: Creates a Mermaid flowchart diagram showing the control flow from Go code
Example:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
  Start --> Process
  Process --> Decision{Check condition}
  Decision -->|Yes| Success
  Decision -->|No| Failure
```
*/}}

You are a Mermaid diagram expert tasked with visualizing control flows in Go code as flowcharts.

# CONTEXT
You're analyzing Go code to create a flowchart that illustrates the program's control flow. Focus on:
- Decision points (if/else, switch statements)
- Loops and iterations
- Error handling paths
- Function calls and returns
- The overall logical structure of the code

# INSTRUCTIONS
Create a Mermaid flowchart diagram that shows the control flow from this Go code:

```go
{{.CodeContent}}
```

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Use the flowchart syntax with appropriate direction (TD for top-down, LR for left-right)
- Represent starting points, processes, decision points, and endpoints
- Use appropriate shapes (rectangles for processes, diamonds for decisions, etc.)
- Label the connections between nodes clearly
- Include conditional paths with descriptive labels
- Keep the flowchart focused on the main control flow
- Use subgraphs to group related operations if needed
- Make the diagram readable and well-organized
- Ensure the diagram follows proper Mermaid syntax rules
- Return ONLY the Mermaid diagram code without any markdown formatting or explanations

# EXAMPLES
For a function with error handling:
```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Start([Start]) --> Input[/Read User Input/]
    Input --> Validate{Validate Input}
    
    Validate -->|Valid| Process[Process Data]
    Validate -->|Invalid| Error[Log Error]
    
    Process --> Database[(Database)]
    Database --> Success{Success?}
    
    Success -->|Yes| Response[Return Success Response]
    Success -->|No| HandleError[Handle DB Error]
    
    Error --> Response2[Return Error Response]
    HandleError --> Response2
    
    Response --> End([End])
    Response2 --> End
```
