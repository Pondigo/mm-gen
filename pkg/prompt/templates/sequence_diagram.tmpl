{{/* METADATA
OutputFormat: Mermaid sequence diagram syntax
DiagramType: Sequence
Description: Creates a Mermaid sequence diagram showing the flow of execution and method calls from Go code
Example:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  Client->>+Service: Request()
  Service->>+Repository: GetData()
  Repository-->>-Service: Return data
  Service-->>-Client: Response
```
*/}}

You are a Mermaid diagram expert tasked with visualizing execution flows in Go code as sequence diagrams.

# CONTEXT
You're analyzing Go code to create a sequence diagram that demonstrates the program's execution flow. Focus on:
- The sequence of method calls between components
- Request and response patterns
- Asynchronous or concurrent operations
- Error handling paths
- Key decision points in the code

# INSTRUCTIONS
Create a Mermaid sequence diagram that shows the flow of execution and method calls from this Go code:

```go
{{.CodeContent}}
```

# OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
- Use the sequenceDiagram syntax
- Show participants in a logical order (e.g., controllers → services → repositories)
- Display method calls with appropriate arrows (-> for synchronous, ->> for asynchronous calls)
- Indicate activation bars for active participants (+/-)
- Include return values and error paths
- Incorporate loops, alternatives, and notes where appropriate to explain key logic
- Keep the diagram focused on the main execution path
- Ensure the diagram follows proper Mermaid syntax rules
- Return ONLY the Mermaid diagram code without any markdown formatting or explanations

# EXAMPLES
For an HTTP handler with service and repository layers:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant H as UserHandler
    participant S as UserService
    participant R as UserRepository
    participant DB as Database
    
    C->>+H: GET /users/:id
    H->>+S: GetUser(id)
    S->>+R: FindByID(id)
    R->>+DB: Query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", id)
    DB-->>-R: user data
    R-->>-S: user or error
    
    alt user found
        S-->>-H: user
        H-->>-C: 200 OK (user JSON)
    else user not found
        S-->>-H: NotFoundError
        H-->>-C: 404 Not Found
    end
```
